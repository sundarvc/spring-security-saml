=== Maintenance Mode

This project is being rewritten in https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security[Spring Security].
As such, it is in maintenance mode, and https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/new[new feature requests] should be logged there.

NOTE: In the past, there were `develop` and `develop-3.0` branches, though these are not maintained, and PRs are no longer being considered on these branches.
No further releases will be issued from these two branches.
Please feel free to fork the repository if you need to make changes.

We continue to consider pull requests for 1.0.x bug fixes, but are not actively developing this project.
